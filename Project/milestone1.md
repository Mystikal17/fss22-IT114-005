<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The The server is configured to listen for incoming connections on a IP<br>address and port. It creates a socket using a server socket API and<br>binds it to the specified IP and port. This sets up the server<br>to be ready to accept incoming connections. The server enters a waiting state,<br>listening for incoming connection requests from clients. It does this by invoking the<br>&quot;listen&quot; method on the server socket. When a client initiates a connection, the<br>server&#39;s socket accepts the connection request, and a new socket is created specifically<br>for this client to handle the communication. The client knows the server&#39;s IP<br>address and port to connect to. It creates a socket using a client<br>socket API and specifies the server&#39;s IP and port for the connection. The<br>client initiates the connection by calling the &quot;connect&quot; method on the socket. If<br>the server is available and accepting connections, the connection is established, and the<br>client socket is connected to the server&#39;s socket. The server&#39;s socket is created<br>and hooks to the IP and port.<div>The server socket enters a listening state,<br>ready to accept incoming connections. The client creates a socket and initiates the<br>connection to the server. The server&#39;s socket accepts the incoming connection request, creating<br>a new socket dedicated to communication with the client. The server is now<br>in a state where it can send and receive messages from the connected<br>client through the new socket. The server starts listening for incoming messages from<br>the client on this socket.</div><br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>So the basics of it is that the client sends a message that<br>message goes to the serverthread to route to where it needs to go<br>wheather its clients or rooms. The client literally just sends a message and<br>gets routed to where it needs to go and get broadcasted. The serverthread<br>itself holds every client/room connected to where they are. When a message is<br>received from a client, the ServerThread routes the message to the appropriate destination<br>based on the recipient&#39;s information. For broadcasting, the ServerThread sends the message to<br>all clients in a specific room. Rooms will hold groups of clients. Messages<br>sent to a room are distributed by the ServerThread to all clients in<br>that room and then broadcasted. Clients are continuously listening for incoming messages, including<br>those sent to them directly or to rooms they in. When a message<br>is received, the client processes it according to the application&#39;s logic, which may<br>involve displaying the message to the user, handling the data, or taking specific<br>actions based on the content of the message.<div>&nbsp;</div><br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> Briefly explain how the various disconnects/terminations are handled</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>So when the whole disconnects happens it just the makes sure&#39;s that the<br>resources are being cleaned up and closing sockets with the client/server. And if<br>the server is still up it makes sure that other clients dont get<br>affected by it.&nbsp;<div><br><div>-Clients disconnected from a socket POV: It closes the socket from<br>the client it can happen by them randomly disconnecting through network/application issues or<br>just them leaving.The client side would be cleaning up resources that are with<br>the socket, releasing any held connections or memory, and notifying the application logic<br>that the connection is terminated.</div><div><br></div><div>-Client program won&#39;t crash when the server disconnects: When<br>the server disconnects or terminates, the client-side should detect this event through socket<br>errors or notifications. It can then take appropriate action, such as attempting to<br>reconnect, notifying the user, or just leaving the application without crashing.</div><div>Using exception handling<br>and callbacks for socket events can help prevent client crashes and allow for<br>error recovery.</div></div><div><br></div><div>-The server won&#39;t crash from the clients disconnecting: Server side,&nbsp; client disconnections<br>will try to maintain server stability and ensure that the server continues to<br>operate without issues. When a client disconnects, the server will see it and<br>clean up any resources associated with that client, such as closing its socket<br>connection. The server is designed to handle multiple client connections concurrently, so the<br>disconnection of one client should not disrupt the service for other connected clients.<br>This is typically achieved through multithreading or asynchronous programming, allowing the server to<br>continue serving other clients even if one client disconnects.</div><br></p><br></td></tr>
